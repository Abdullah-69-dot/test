# State Replacer

A simple Python script that replaces a specific keyword (such as `state`) with a user-provided name in a text or file.

## Project Idea

- The user enters a name (for example, the name of a state or any other word).
- The program searches for the keyword (`state`) in a text or file.
- All instances of the keyword are replaced with the userâ€™s input.

## How to Use

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. When prompted, enter the name you want to insert instead of `state`.
3. The program will output the modified text or create a file with all replacements done.

## Example

- Original text:
    ```
    Welcome to state!
    ```
- After running the program and entering "Cairo":
    ```
    Welcome to Cairo!
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3
